# Todoconta Landing Page

This is the official landing page for **Todoconta**, a provider of accounting services and tax consulting in Mexico. This project was migrated from WordPress to Astro to create a fast, SEO-friendly, and secure user experience.

The live site can be found at [todoconta.com](https://todoconta.com).

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Modern Tech Stack**: Built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and TypeScript for optimal performance and developer experience.
- **SEO Focused**: Features extensive 301 redirects to preserve SEO ranking from the previous WordPress site, sitemap generation, and security headers.
- **Content-Driven**: Uses Astro's type-safe Content Collections (`src/content/`) to manage services and products using Markdown files.
- **Optimized for Performance**: Implements features like inlined stylesheets, esbuild for minification, and HTML compression.
- **Developer Experience**: Comes with pre-configured ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript type-checking for code quality and consistency.

## üöÄ Project Structure

The project follows a standard Astro directory structure:

- `src/pages`: Contains all site pages, utilizing Astro's file-based routing. Dynamic routes like `[product].astro` are used for content collections.
- `src/components`: Reusable Astro components for UI elements (e.g., `Navbar.astro`, `ServiceCard.astro`).
- `src/layouts`: Defines the overall HTML structure for different page types (e.g., `LandingLayout.astro`).
- `src/content`: Manages all dynamic content. Each subdirectory (e.g., `products`, `services`) is a separate collection defined in `src/content/config.ts`.
- `src/styles`: Global CSS and style files.
- `public`: Stores all static assets like images, `robots.txt`, and the favicon.
- `astro.config.mjs`: The main Astro configuration file, containing site settings, redirects, and build optimizations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Astro](https://astro.build/)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Code Quality**: [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) & [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
